# Dataset

+  env.csv & env2.csv: two sets parsed from Central Park weather data. 
+  EnvironmentDataParser.ipynb & dayofweek.ipynb: Jupyter python notebook, we used to parse weather data.
+  download.sh: a bash shell to download datasets from NYC TLC Trip Record Data. Please change the path before use.
+  The other datasets like taxi data are too large. So we do not show them here.
