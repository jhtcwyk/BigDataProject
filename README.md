##Project Topic
We have selected the project area – “exploring NYC Taxi Trips”.
We would use the following datasets –

We are also planning to work with Stock Data and study various patterns.

Tasks to be carried out –

+	Analyzing the taxi data to find statistical models, like Regions with large number of drop offs at morning peak hours to find work areas.
+	To give other statistics such as time interval of the day when maximum taxis are used, areas with least taxi drop offs.
+	Most popular taxi destinations such as tourist places.
+	Taxi usage distribution over different seasons.
+	Analyze Weather Information and co-relate with Taxi usage
+	Mode of transport preferred by residents, eg. citibikes, taxis.
+	Studying the Distances for Uber, NYC taxi, and CItibike. By doing this we may find a pattern such as for small distances residents prefer Citibike.
+	Studying the stock prices for NYC cabs and Uber to find any pattern or impact of on each other.
+	To create a website to visualize the data

## Project Topic
Our topic is exploring the NYC taxi trips. 

+ Make statisticals and analyzing the taxi data to find universal laws like finding the peak in a day.
+	Train K-Means cluster model to analyze pickup position.
+	Prepare Weather Information and join with taxi trips.
+	Train prediction model for taxi pickup number in one hour window.
+	Make statisticals for Uber and CItibike. Find a pattern or impact on each dataset.
+	Visualize the data.
